# QueryVision
## QueryVision

QueryVision is a multimodal question-answer application designed to enhance information retrieval efficiency and comprehensiveness. With QueryVision, users can input an image, specify its role, and pose a question to receive relevant text responses.

### Overview:
QueryVision leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro Vision, a state-of-the-art large language vision model. Gemini Pro Vision is capable of understanding input from both text and visual modalities, including images and videos, enabling it to generate contextually relevant text responses.

### Features:
- **Multimodal Question-Answering**: QueryVision accepts inputs in the form of images and questions, providing text-based answers based on the content of the images and the posed questions.
- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: By combining text and visual understanding, QueryVision offers a more efficient and comprehensive approach to information retrieval.
- **Powered by Gemini Pro Vision**: Gemini Pro Vision, the underlying model of QueryVision, is renowned for its versatility in multimodal tasks such as visual understanding, classification, summarization, and content creation from image and video inputs.

### How it Works:
1. **Input Image**: Users upload an image to QueryVision.
2. **Specify Image Role**: Users specify the role or context of the image (e.g., document, photograph, infographic).
3. **Pose Question**: Users pose a question related to the content of the uploaded image.
4. **Get Response**: QueryVision utilizes Gemini Pro Vision to process the image and question, generating relevant text responses.

### Applications:
- **Educational**: QueryVision can assist students in understanding visual content by providing textual explanations.
- **Research**: Researchers can utilize QueryVision for efficient information retrieval from visual datasets.
- **Content Creation**: Content creators can leverage QueryVision to generate textual descriptions or summaries of images for various purposes.

### Disclaimer:
QueryVision is an experimental application intended for research and experimentation purposes only. It should not be used for mission-critical or production applications.
